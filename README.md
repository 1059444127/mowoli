# Mowoli - DICOM Modality Worklist with HTTP API

**NOTE: This is prototype stuff!**


## Quickstart

- Install DCM4CHE 2

- Download and unpack the
  [latest version of *dcm4che2*](http://sourceforge.net/projects/dcm4che/files/dcm4che2/)
  into */usr/local* and create a symlink (i.e. `cd /usr/local && ln -s dcm4che-2.0.28 dcm4che`)
- Install XCode along with Command Line Developer Tools
- Install [foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman)
- Install Bundler with `sudo gem install bundler`
- clone this repo and `cd` into it
- bootstrap with...

```console
bundle install
bin/rake db:create db:schema:load
foreman start
```

Create some stations with the [web UI](http://localhost:5000/stations)
and then you're ready to create some worklist entries by HTTP POST requests,
i.e. from your console:

```console
/usr/bin/curl \
  -F 'entry[patient_id]=674563' \
  -F 'entry[patients_name]=Hasselhoff^David' \
  -F 'entry[patients_birth_date]=1952-07-17' \
  -F 'entry[patients_sex]=M' \
  -F 'entry[referring_physicians_name]=House^Gregory^^Dr.' \
  -F 'entry[requesting_physicians_name]=Volakis^Amber^^Dr.' \
  -F 'entry[requested_procedure_description]=brain' \
  -F 'entry[station_name]=PHILIPS_MR' \
  -F 'entry[accession_number]=9837613118' \
  http://localhost:5000/entries
```

Entries are visible over the [web UI](http://localhost:5000/entries) as well.

## Worklist Attributes

### Study Instance UID

Study Instance UIDs are generated automatically.
They constist of a fixed *org root* and a random integer UUID in order to make
them practically collision-free:

```
<org root>.<random integer UUID>
```

The *org root* is "1.2.826.0.1.3680043.9.5265."
